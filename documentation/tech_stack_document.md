# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the key technologies chosen for the **codeguide-starter** project. It’s written in everyday language so anyone—technical or not—can understand why each tool was picked and how it supports the application.

## 1. Frontend Technologies
The frontend is everything the user sees and interacts with. For this project, we’ve used:

- **Next.js (App Router)**
  - A React framework that makes page routing, server-side rendering, and API routes very simple.
  - Enhances user experience by pre-rendering pages on the server or at build time, leading to faster initial load.
- **React 18**
  - The underlying library for building user interfaces with reusable components.
  - Provides a smooth, interactive experience thanks to its virtual DOM and modern hooks.
- **TypeScript**
  - A superset of JavaScript that adds types (labels for data).
  - Helps catch errors early during development and makes the code easier to maintain.
- **CSS (globals.css & theme.css)**
  - **globals.css** applies base styles (fonts, colors, resets) across the entire app.
  - **dashboard/theme.css** defines the look and feel specific to the dashboard area.
  - This separation keeps styles organized and avoids accidental style conflicts.

By combining these tools, we have a clear structure (Next.js folders for pages and layouts), safer code (TypeScript), and flexible styling with vanilla CSS.

## 2. Backend Technologies
The backend handles data, user accounts, and the logic behind the scenes. Our choices here are:

- **Next.js API Routes**
  - Allows us to write server-side code (`route.ts` files) alongside our frontend in the same project.
  - Runs on Node.js, so we can handle requests like sign-up, sign-in, and data fetching in one place.
- **Node.js Runtime**
  - The JavaScript environment on the server that executes our API routes.
- **bcrypt** (npm package)
  - A library for hashing passwords securely before storing them.
  - Ensures that even if someone got access to our data, raw passwords aren’t visible.
- **(Optional) NextAuth.js or JWT**
  - While this starter kit shows a custom authentication flow, it can easily integrate services like NextAuth.js for email-based login or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless sessions.

These components work together to receive user credentials, verify or store them securely, manage sessions or tokens, and deliver protected data back to the frontend.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment
Infrastructure covers where and how we host the app, as well as how changes get delivered:

- **Git & GitHub**
  - Version control system (Git) and remote hosting (GitHub) keep track of all code changes and allow team collaboration.
- **Vercel (or Netlify)**
  - A popular hosting service optimized for Next.js, with one-click deployments and global content delivery.
  - Automatically rebuilds and deploys the site whenever code is pushed to the main branch.
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**
  - Automates tasks like linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier), and running any tests you add.
  - Ensures that only clean, tested code goes live.

Together, these tools provide a reliable, scalable setup where every code change is tested and deployed quickly, with minimal manual work.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations
While this starter kit is minimal by design, it already includes or can easily add:

- **bcrypt**
  - For secure password hashing (included as an npm dependency).
- **NextAuth.js** (optional)
  - A full-featured authentication library supporting email/password, OAuth, and more.
- **Sentry or LogRocket** (optional)
  - For real-time error tracking and performance monitoring in production.

These integrations help extend the app’s capabilities without building every feature from scratch.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations
We’ve baked in several measures to keep users safe and the app running smoothly:

Security:
- Passwords are never stored in plain text—bcrypt hashes them with a random salt.
- API routes can implement CSRF protection and input validation to block malicious requests.
- Session tokens or cookies are marked secure and HttpOnly to prevent theft via JavaScript.

Performance:
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) in Next.js deliver pages faster.
- Code splitting and lazy-loaded components ensure users only download what they need.
- Global CSS and theme files are small and cached by the browser for quick repeat visits.

These strategies work together to give users a fast, secure experience every time.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary
In building **codeguide-starter**, we chose technologies that:

- Align with modern web standards (Next.js, React, TypeScript).
- Provide a clear, file-based project structure for rapid onboarding.
- Offer built-in support for server-side rendering, API routes, and static assets.
- Emphasize security through password hashing, session management, and safe defaults.
- Enable easy scaling and future enhancements via modular code and optional integrations.

This stack strikes a balance between simplicity for newcomers and flexibility for experienced teams. It accelerates development of a secure authentication flow and a polished dashboard, while leaving room to plug in databases, test suites, and advanced features as the project grows.
