# Backend Structure Document

This document outlines the backend architecture, hosting, and infrastructure for the **codeguide-starter** project. It uses plain language so anyone can understand how the backend is set up and how it supports the application.

## 1. Backend Architecture

- **Framework and Design Pattern**
  - We use **Next.js API Routes** to handle all server-side logic. These routes live alongside the frontend code in the same repository, making development and deployment simpler.
  - The backend follows a **layered pattern**:
    1. **API Layer**: Receives requests (login, registration, data fetch).  
    2. **Service Layer**: Contains the core business logic (user validation, password hashing).  
    3. **Data Access Layer**: Talks to the database via a simple ORM (e.g., Prisma or TypeORM).

- **Scalability**
  - Stateless API routes can scale horizontally—new instances can spin up on demand.  
  - We can add caching or a message queue (e.g., Redis or RabbitMQ) without changing the core code.

- **Maintainability**
  - Code for each feature is grouped by route (authentication, dashboard).  
  - A service layer separates complex logic from request handling.

- **Performance**
  - Lightweight Node.js handlers keep response times low.  
  - Future use of database connection pooling and Redis for caching repeated queries.

## 2. Database Management

- **Database Choice**
  - We recommend **PostgreSQL** for structured data and reliable transactions.  
  - In-memory caching can be added later with **Redis** for session tokens or frequently read data.

- **Data Storage and Access**
  - Use an ORM like **Prisma** or **TypeORM** to map JavaScript/TypeScript objects to database tables.
  - Connection pooling ensures efficient use of database connections under load.
  - Migrations track schema changes over time, keeping development, staging, and production in sync.

- **Data Practices**
  - Passwords are never stored in plain text—they are salted and hashed with **bcrypt** before saving.
  - All outgoing data is typed and validated to prevent malformed records.

## 3. Database Schema

### Human-Readable Format

- **Users**
  - **id**: Unique identifier  
  - **email**: User’s email address (unique)  
  - **password_hash**: Securely hashed password  
  - **created_at**: Account creation timestamp

- **Sessions**
  - **id**: Unique session record  
  - **user_id**: Links to a user  
  - **token**: Random string for authentication  
  - **expires_at**: When the token stops working  
  - **created_at**: When the session was created

- **DashboardItems** *(optional for dynamic data)*
  - **id**: Unique record  
  - **title**: Item title  
  - **content**: Item details  
  - **created_at**: When the item was added

### SQL Schema (PostgreSQL)
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Sessions table
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Dashboard items table
CREATE TABLE dashboard_items (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```  

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

- **Approach**: We follow a **RESTful** style, grouping related endpoints under `/api` directories.

- **Key Endpoints**
  - `POST /api/auth/register`  
    • Accepts `{ email, password }`  
    • Creates a new user and issues a session token  
  - `POST /api/auth/login`  
    • Accepts `{ email, password }`  
    • Verifies credentials and returns a session token  
  - `POST /api/auth/logout`  
    • Invalidates the session token on the server  
  - `GET /api/dashboard/data`  
    • Requires a valid session  
    • Returns user-specific data or dashboard items  

- **Communication**
  - Frontend sends JSON requests; backend replies with JSON and appropriate HTTP status codes.  
  - Protected routes check for a valid session token (in cookies or Authorization header).

## 5. Hosting Solutions

- **Cloud Provider**:  
  - **Vercel** (recommended) offers seamless Next.js deployments, auto-scaling, and built-in CDN.  
  - Alternatively, **Netlify** or any Node.js-capable host will work.

- **Benefits**
  - **Reliability**: Global servers and failover across regions.  
  - **Scalability**: Auto-scale serverless functions based on traffic.  
  - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Pay-per-use model means low cost for small projects.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

- **Load Balancer**
  - Provided by the hosting platform—distributes API requests across function instances.

- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**
  - Vercel’s global edge network caches static assets (CSS, JS, images) for faster page loads.

- **Caching**
  - **Redis** (optional) for session storage or caching dashboard queries to reduce database load.

- **Object Storage**
  - For file uploads or backups, integrate with AWS S3 or similar services.

- **Message Queue**
  - In future, use **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** for background tasks (e.g., email notifications).

## 7. Security Measures

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Passwords hashed with **bcrypt** and salted.  
  - Session tokens stored in secure, HttpOnly cookies or Authorization headers.  
  - Protected endpoints verify tokens before proceeding.

- **Data Encryption**
  - **HTTPS/TLS** encrypts data in transit.  
  - Database connections use SSL to encrypt data between the app and the database.

- **Input Validation**
  - Every incoming request is validated (e.g., valid email format, password length) to prevent SQL injection or other attacks.

- **Web Security Best Practices**
  - Enable **CORS** policies to limit allowed origins.  
  - Use **CSRF tokens** or same-site cookies to prevent cross-site requests.  
  - Set secure headers with **Helmet** or a similar middleware.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Performance Monitoring**
  - Integrate **Sentry** or **LogRocket** for real-time crash reporting and performance tracing.  
  - Use Vercel’s built-in analytics to track request latencies and error rates.

- **Logging**
  - Structured logs (JSON) for all API requests and errors, shipped to a log management service like **Datadog** or **Logflare**.

- **Health Checks**
  - Define a `/health` endpoint that returns a 200 status if the service is up and the database is reachable.

- **Maintenance Strategies**
  - Automated migrations run on deploy to keep the database schema up to date.  
  - Scheduled dependency audits and security scans (e.g., `npm audit`).
  - Regular backups of the database (daily or weekly depending on usage).

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The backend for **codeguide-starter** is built on Next.js API Routes and Node.js, paired with PostgreSQL for data and optional Redis for caching. It follows a clear layered architecture that keeps code easy to maintain and extend. With RESTful endpoints for authentication and data, secure practices like password hashing and HTTPS, and hosting on Vercel for scalability and global performance, this setup meets the project’s goals for a fast, secure, and developer-friendly foundation. Future enhancements—such as background job queues, advanced monitoring, or richer data models—can be added without disrupting the core structure.
